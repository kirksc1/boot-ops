# Boot-Ops

## Overview
Boot-Ops is a framework designed to aid in the creation of [GitOps][gitops] 
infrastructure automation processes using the [Spring Boot][springboot] platform.
It offers an event-based approach to processing state changes that can be parallelized
and easily expanded or adapted to individual needs.
